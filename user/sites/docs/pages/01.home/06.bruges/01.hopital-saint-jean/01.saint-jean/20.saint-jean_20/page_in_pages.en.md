## St. John the Evangelist according to the Golden Legend {.orange}

65. saint John in front of the Latin door

John, appetizer and evangelist, preached in Ephese, when he was arrested by the proconsul and invited to sacrifice to the gods.  
As he refused, he was thrown in prison; We send to the Emperor Domitien a letter designating him as a sacrilege magician, contemptuous of the gods and prespeaker of the Crucified.  
On the order of Domitian, Jean is then led to Rome where, after cutting all his hair by derision, in front of the door of the city we call Latin, we flagship and cast it into a cauldron of oil under which burning fire was burning.  
But John felt no pain and came out completely unscathed, not burnt but anointed.  
In this view, Domitian was stunned and feared to put him to death. So, in this place, Christians have built a church, and today is solemnly celebrated as that of John's martyrdom. As he had not renounced preaching Christ, Domitian ordered to relegate him to the island of Patmos.
