## St. John the Evangelist according to the Golden Legend {.orange #jean-selon-legende-2}

65. saint John in front of the Latin gate

John, appetizer and evangelist, preached in Ephese, when he was arrested by the proconsul and invited to sacrifice to the gods.  
As he refused, he was thrown in prison; We send to the Emperor Domitian a letter designating him as a sacrilege magician, contemptuous of the gods and prespeaker of the Crucified.  
By order of Domitian, John was then taken to Rome where, after having derisively cut his hair, in front of the gate of the city called «Latin», he was flogged and thrown into a cauldron of boiling oil under which a fiery fire was burning.  
But John felt no pain and came out completely unscathed, not burnt but anointed.  
In this view, Domitian was stunned and feared to put him to death. So, in this place, Christians have built a church, and today is solemnly celebrated as that of John's martyrdom. As he had not renounced preaching Christ, Domitian ordered to relegate him to the island of Patmos.
