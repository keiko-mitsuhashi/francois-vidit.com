## [color=#e6a64d]St. Barbara following the Golden Legend[/color]

There was in Nicomedia, at the time of Emperor Maximian, a pagan named Dioscorus who was from a very distinguished family with great wealth.  
He had a daughter of great beauty, who called Barbara.  
Her father loved her very much; 
And so that no man could see her, he put her in a very high tower that he raised.  
From his earliest age, Barbara, feeling the void of earthly things, began to apply to the meditation of things from heaven.  
After entering a temple, and seeing along the walls the statues of idols, she asked her parents:  
— «What do these images of human beings mean?»  
Her parents answered her:  
— «Shut down; 
they are not human beings, 
but gods, 
and they want to be adored.»  
Barbara says:  
— «Were they human beings once?»  
And she was answered that yes.  
And she was reflecting on this day and night, saying herself:  
«If our gods were human beings, they were born like human beings, they died like human beings; 
if they were gods, they would not be born and they would not be dead; 
because the Divinity, to it looks like to me, does not start and cannot stop.»  
So she came to despise those supposed gods of wood or stone; 
but he still lacked knowledge of the true God.  
In the meantime, the renown spread to Nicomedia that there was in Alexandria a man of immeasurable wisdom, named Origen, who demonstrated the existence of true God and the vanity of idols.  
In learning this, Barbara was filled with joy, and she looked at how she could go to hear it.  
but she did not dare to talk to her father, and she adopted the idea of writing to Origen; 
what she did with the words:  
«To Origen of Alexandria, whose glory is universally widespread, I, Barbara, of Nicomedia.  
Your servant is yearning for that you to conduct her to the knowledge of the true God.  
From the very first dawn of my reason, I felt in all my heart the strongest desire to arrive to this knowledge, and I always thought that the Divinity could not be in images, work of our hands, that cannot speak nor hear.  
I also thought that those who had been human beings, and were represented as gods, could not be; 
because human being begins and ends, but God is before all times and after all times.  
And I put my confidence in this God who is unknown to me, but who created all things; 
I devoted my love to him, and I will spare nothing to get to know him.  
The fame of your talents came to me, and I thought,  
that you, venerable father, would take me to the science of this God you preach.  
And I hope you will disperse the darkness of my ignorance and that you will conduct me in the light of true faith.»  
Having sent his letter to Origen, she prayed to the Lord weeping tears and saying:  
«Lord, strengthen the foot of the one that I sent to your servant, so that the light I have asked for comes.»  
The messenger arrived in Alexandria, 
and he found Origen in the palace of the mother of Emperor Alexander, Mamaea, 
and he was busy preaching the doctrine of Jesus Christ.  
He received with great joy the letter from Barbara,  
and he praised God for that he would be arousing such enthusiasm, 
and rushed to answer her:  
«Origen, unworthy priest of Jesus Christ, 
and perhaps his preacher, still remaining in Alexandria, 
to Barbara, of the race of Gentiles, but by adoption of the race of the children of God and Jesus Christ.  
I will teach you, as you ask me, what is the real God.  
Know that it is one in substance and three in persons: the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.  
Whoever believes in this doctrine has what he needs to reach God.  
So add up to it credibility to complete what is lacking in your desire; 
see my envoy, 
he will inform you of law of God 
and he will read you the holy books he carries with him. 
Do not fear being exposed to great torments for the name of Jesus Christ.  
He said:  
«The one who loses for me his soul in this world shall keep it in eternal life.»  
Origen sent one of his disciples to confer with Barbara, 
and when she was told that he had arrived, 
she immediately said to have him to enter.  
The servant of God greeted her in the name of Jesus Christ.  
And now his father came, 
and seeing a stranger,  
he became scared and he said:  
— «What is this man and what is he doing?»  
The Alexandrine replied that he was educated about the science of medicine, and that he had a master who, against the usage of doctors, also healed souls.  
The father of Barbara, hearing that, withdrew and let them talk.  
And the christian, who called himself Valentin, explained to Barbara the sacred mysteries of religion, 
and he baptized her in that same tower where his father had put her, 
and handed over the books sent by Origen.  
She applied much to read them, 
and she did, albeit without master, great progress in the science of divine things.

Some says that because of her beauty some nobles of that country falled in love for her, 
and they talked to her father so that she took a husband.  
And his father, going to the tower, sought to decide it, saying:  
— «My daughter, powerful figures remembered you, 
and told me that they would take you into marriage; 
what do you want to do?»  
She answered her father by looking at him with anger: 
— «Don't force me to do this, my father».  
He left her, 
and getting away from her, he brought a large number of workers, 
and he ordered them to build a bathroom house, and he went to a far away country.  
Barbara got down from the tower to see what has been done, 
and she saw that on the north side there were only two windows, 
and she told the workers:  
— «Why did you make these two windows?»  
And they answered:  
— «Your father ordered it so.»  
She replied:  
— «Make another window for me.»  
And they responded:  
— «We fear that your father get annoyed at us.»  
She says:  
— «Do what I tell you, 
and I will bring my father to give his approval.»  
So they made another window.  
Barbara put with her own hand on the side of the orient, in this building, a precious cross; 
and, going back to the tower, she saw the idols that her father loved.  
Obeying to the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, she spit in their face and said:  
— «Shall they become similar to you, those who make you and those who put their trust into you».  
When the building got finished, his father returned from his trip, 
and when he saw the three windows, he told the workers:  
— «Why did you make three windows?»  
They replied:  
— «Your daughter ordered us.»  
He then told his daughter:  
— «Who did you order to make three windows?»  
She replied:  
— «I have had good reasons for doing so; 
because three windows illuminate the whole human being».  
And his father brought him with him in the bathroom, and told him:  
— «Why do three windows shed more light than two?»  
She replied:  
— «There are three that illuminate the world and set the course of stars: the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, and they are one in essence.»  
So his father, full of fury, pulled his sword to kill her.  
But the Saint did her prayer to God, 
and the walls opened, 
and she was carried on a mountain where two shepherds were having their sheep grazing.  
His father began her search, and he went to these shepherds and asked them if they had seen his daughter.  
One of them, seeing how angry the father was because he did not know where she was, kept quiet; the other pointed her with his finger.  
St. Barbara cursed the one who betrayed her, 
and on the spot he was changed into a marble statue, 
and his sheep were converted into grasshoppers; 
but this story is apocryphal.  
His father, found her, beat her, pulled her by hair 
and attached her with chains.  
He locked up in a dungeon 
and put guards there, 
and he went away to warn Proconsul Marcian for all that happened.  
The proconsul wanted Barbara to be brought before him. 
When he saw him, he was struck by her great beauty, and he told her:  
— «If you want to save yourself, sacrifice to the immortal gods, or you will die in the greatest torments.»  
She replied:  
— «I want to offer myself in sacrifice to my God Jesus Christ, who has done heaven and earth and all that is contained therein.  
As for the demons you love, the prophet said:  
They have a mouth but do not speak; 
they have eyes but do not see; 
those who pay tribute to them will look like them.»  
The proconsul, furious, ordered to strip her and beat her indiscriminately with beef nerve.  
And when all her body was in blood, he ordered to bring her back to prison until she had decided what torment he would inflict on her.  
In the middle of the night, great clarity wrapped the martyr, and　Jesus Christ appeared and told her:  
— «Take courage, my daughter; 
there will be great joy in heaven and on earth during your passion; 
do not fear the threats of the tyrant; 
I'm with you to preserve all evils.»  
St. Barbara felt a great joy in the words of the Lord, 
and in the morning she reappeared in front of the proconsul, who, seeing that there was no trace of the blows she had received the day before, told her:  
— «See how much the gods are in favour of you and they love you, because they have healed your wounds.»  
Barbara replied to him:  
— «Your gods are like you, deaf, blind and mute; 
how could they have healed me? 
The one who healed me is Jesus Christ, the Son of the living God; 
But you don't see it, because your heart is hardened by the devil.»  
The proconsul, quivering like a infuriated lion, ordered that she has her ribs burned with the torches and her head beatten with a hammer.  
The Saint, looking at the sky, says:  
— «You know, Lord, that I am suffering for your love; 
don't leave me now.»  
The impious proconsul commanded that she had her udders cut; 
and she says:  
— «Do not reject me out of your presence, Lord, and shall not deprive me of the Holy Spirit.»  
He then ordered that she would be taken naked thrue the city, beattening her; 
and she says:  
— «Lord, you who are my support and covers the sky of clouds, cover my body, so that it is not exposed in the eyes of impiouses.»  
And he descended from heaven a angel who brought him a white tunic.  
The proconsul ordered that she had her head cut; 
but his father seizes her and led her to the mountain, 
and she made that prayer:  
— «Lord Jesus, to whom all things obey, grant that those who invoke your holy name by remembering my martyrdom, finds their sins forgetten on the day of judgment.»  
And she heard a voice that came from heaven and who replied: 
— «Come, my beloved.  
rest in the home of my father who is in heaven; 
what you are asking for has been given to you.»  
And the martyr had the head cut off by the hands of her own father.  
And when he came down from the mountain, the fire of heaven fell on him and consumed him, 
and not even a vestige of him remained.

There was a powerful man, a Count of Saxony,  
who made his enemy prisoner and locked it in a tower, defending, under the greatest penalties, that no one would give him to drink or eat.  
After he stayed there a few days,  
he prayed, moaning, the guardian of the tower, to give him, for the love of Sainte Barbara, a little bread, so that he would not die;
the guard did not pay attention to his complaints, 
and he was lying felting faint; 
the guardian believed him dead, 
and asked the Count for permission to remove the corpse before he spread a bad smell; 
So they tied a rope to the neck of the one that was believed to be dead, 
and we rushed it down from the top of the rock.  
as soon as he hit the ground he stood up, 
and all those who were there escaped, seized of fear.  
He called them back and told them not to be afraid; 
And they came closer to him, and they asked how he could support his existence, 
and he answered them:  
— «St. Barbara assisted me in all my sorrows;  
it was her who supported me in my fall, 
and I cannot die before I confessed myself and be received the holy communion,»  
Asked why he had obtained this grace, he answered:  
— «I never missed a year of fasting and praying on the day of St. Barbara's fest to make her happy,  
and that is why she asked God that I wouldn't die without having received the sacraments.»  
And as soon as he received them, he breathed out.  
We also read that at the time of the king of the Romans, Adolphe, a count has been put at the head of the government of the provinces of Orient, and a soldier was accused of having made violence against a young girl.  
While he was in prison, waiting for his judgment, he asked to confess, 
and his confessor acknowledged that he was innocent, he had to go to the service of St. Barbara, and promised not to return home until he had made a pilgrimage in his honour.  
The woman was claiming out for a judgment, and the judges had come together and brought the accused before them, sentenced him to death; 
Then he introduced someone who no one knew, and who, having asked to speak, proved, for relevant and undeniable reasons, that the soldier was not guilty and that the sentence was unfair.  
And the judges revocked him; 
and the soldier, let back to freedom, ended his days in the service of St. Barbara,  
and the unknown man who served him as lawyer disappeared without nobody knew who he was.
